# Signature-verification-and-automatic-attendance-marking-system


The project aims to create a simple attendance marking system without any sensors. During the offline classes, an attendance sheet with students' roll numbers, names, and a space for signatures is circulated among students. They are asked to mark their presence by giving their signatures in the signature column. Below one is an example of the attendance sheet.
